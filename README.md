# Advent-of-Code-1

Per http://adventofcode.com/day/1

Pretty simple program that reads from a file and tracks santa's floor position via an integer value. It's assumed that santa doesn't have the stamina to reach floors that would cause an overflow, but that sort of protection wouldn't be very difficult to add.

Part II of the question adds an object (BasementTracker) that tracks when santa stumbles onto a basement floor (if ever) and when.
